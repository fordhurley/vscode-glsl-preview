vscode-glsl-preview [WIP]
-------------------------

This is an unreleased extension for the VS Code text editor for live previewing
GLSL fragment shaders, in the vein of
[atom-glsl-preview](https://github.com/fordhurley/atom-glsl-preview).

TODO:
- [x] Show a webview with a canvas.
- [x] When editing a GLSL file, run the file contents as a shader.
- [x] Provide textures and `u_resolution`, `u_time`, and `u_mouse` uniforms.
- [ ] Figure out how to do textures the right way.
- [ ] Configuration.
- [ ] Serialization.
- [ ] `glslify`.
- [ ] Error display (e.g., highlight line).
